# The game
Hidden by the white whiteness of the clouds, there is a world where floating islands are home to great schools for the young creatures of the five magical realms. Sweet little dragons, clumsy fairies, mischievous elves, little unicorns and frogs who dream of becoming princes show up at the doors of the schools, with the hope of being admitted into the great hall and being able to admire the famous professors of their kingdom. Run one of the four great schools of Eriantys and compete with other wizards to increase your fame!
